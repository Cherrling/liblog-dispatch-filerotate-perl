This is the debian package for the Log-Dispatch-FileRotate module.
It was created by Matthias Schmitz <matthias@sigxcpu.org> using dh-make-perl.

It was downloaded from http://search.cpan.org/dist/Log-Dispatch-FileRotate/

The upstream author is: 

Mark Pfeiffer, <markpf at mlp-consulting dot com dot au> inspired by
Dave Rolsky's, <autarch at urth dot org>, code :-)

Kevin Goess <cpan at goess dot org> suggested multiple writers should be
supported. He also conned me into doing the time based stuff.
Thanks Kevin! :-)

Thanks also to Dan Waldheim for helping with some of the
locking issues in a forked environment.

And thanks to Stephen Gordon for his more portable code on lockfile
naming..
